    * drop shared_ptr and use a normal pointer. removed boost dependency

libcec (0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * interface changes:
    * added GetDevicePowerStatus()/cec_get_device_power_status()

    * added GetDeviceMenuLanguage()/cec_get_device_menu_language()
    * added GetDeviceCecVersion()/cec_get_device_cec_version()
    * added SwitchMonitoring()/cec_switch_monitoring() to the interface. when
      monitoring is enabled, the device will only log the data it received,

    * removed timeout parameter in Transmit() and included the ack timeout in
       the cec_command struct
    * made the vendor id -> vendor name translation available
    * made CEC_LOG levels powers of 2
    * introduced CEC_LOG_TRAFFIC log level

    * wait for the processor thread to start before continueing on startup
    * wait for messages to be transmitted before continueing in
      CCECProcessor::Transmit()
    * only set the logical address once when it has changed
    * correct source for broadcast messages
    * win32: create Release type installer
  * changed:
    * make all reads and write in CAdapterCommunication go through buffers.
    * poll for a vendor ID of connected devices and switch to a non-standard
      CEC implementation if needed.
    * added vendor detection of Samsung and LG devices
    * handle samsung remote command 'return'
  * cec-client:
    * added -la and --logical-address to the command line params
    * added -d and --log-level params to cec-client
    * added -sf and --short-log-file, which only log the actual messages, not
      the level and timestamp
    * added -f and --log-file parameters to cec-client
    * added option to change the log level to cec-client

libcec (0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * send a keypress with 0 duration when a key is pressed and with a duration
    set when it's released
  * added SetOSDString() to the interface (not supported by all tvs)
  * fixed: 'routing change' is a broadcast message. log routing changes, but
    don't send a 'set active view' message, so the active input won't be
    changed
  * log keypresses in the debug log
  * added 'pa' command to cec-client, to change the physical address
  * added SetPhysicalAddress()/cec_set_physical_address() to the interface, so
    the HDMI port number to use can be changed
  * fixed: put the message processing code from WaitForAck() in ParseMessage().
    fixes missing incoming message logging of non-data messages when not
    waiting for an ACK
  * added 'txn' command to cec-client. same as 'tx', but doesn't wait for ACK
    before returning
  * fixed: set initiator and destination first in cec_command::push_back().
    fixes 'tx' command in cec-client
  * fixed: keep trying to connect while iTimeout isn't reached (default 10
    seconds). fixes exit with a 'permission denied' error when the device isn't
    ready yet. remove CEC_SETTLE_DOWN_TIME
  * fixed: don't call SetActiveView() when reporting the power status. fixes
    loop which causes some TVs to report failed connections
  * fixed: eom was not being parsed when receiving MSGCODE_FRAME_DATA. fixed.
  * fixed: add the device type as parameter when sending the physical address.
    thanks bobo1on1
  * fixed: typo in libcec.pc.in
  * added optional strLib parameter to LoadLibCec(), so the location of the
    shared library can be specified
  * only link cec-client against ld. use AC_SEARCH_LIBS instead of AC_CHECK_LIB
  * use int instead of bool on the public C interface and remove stdbool.h include
  * renamed: CECExports.h => cec.h, CECExportsC.h => cecc.h, CECLoader.h =>
    cecloader.h, CECTypes.h => cectypes.h
  * updated debian package. split up libcec and libcec-dev
  * fixed: changed to use dlopen instead of static linkage. shuffled headers a
    bit. bumped interface to version 7
  * removed 'rt' from libraries. it's not needed (anymore)
  * fixed: reset the active view after a routing change. issue #1
  * fixed: changed attached license to be GPLv2 instead of GPLv3 this was an
    error as libCEC is licensed GPLv2 not GPLv3 thanks @garbear
  * added contributors link

    SetLogicalAddress()/cec_set_logical_address() instead. add 'la' command to
    the testclient to set the logical address of the cec adapter

    LoadLibCec()/cec_init() on the interface. fixed wrongly placed namespace
    close tag in CECExports.h. updated interface documentation. bumped
    interface version to 2.
