  * added a Close() method to the interface

    read by a client with GetNextCommand()/cec_get_next_command(). added a
    'help' command to the test client, that displays all available commands
  * Fixed setting the ackmask. deprecated SetAckMask()/cec_set_ack_mask(). use
    SetLogicalAddress()/cec_set_logical_address() instead. add 'la' command to
    the testclient to set the logical address of the cec adapter
  * Added optional logical and physical address parameters to
    LoadLibCec()/cec_init() on the interface. fixed wrongly placed namespace
    close tag in CECExports.h. updated interface documentation. bumped
    interface version to 2.
  * fixed hardcoded ackmask in SetAckMast(). set a shorter display name in the
    test client. the previous one was too long and being rejected
